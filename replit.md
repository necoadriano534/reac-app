# Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React (frontend) and Express.js (backend), featuring user authentication, profile management, and a modern dark-themed UI. The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence and includes features like password reset via email, avatar uploads, and role-based access control.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build Tool**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)

**UI Component Library**
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- shadcn/ui component system with "new-york" style preset
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling with custom theme configuration
- Class Variance Authority (CVA) for managing component variants
- Framer Motion for animations

**State Management**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and data fetching
- React Context API for authentication state
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

**Design System**
- Custom color scheme with CSS variables for theming
- Dark gradient theme with purple/blue accent colors
- Custom fonts: Outfit for headings, Inter for body text
- Reusable UI components following atomic design principles

## Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js with TypeScript for REST API endpoints
- Node.js HTTP server for production deployment
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Development hot-reload with tsx

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Session-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies
- bcrypt for password hashing (using 10 rounds)
- Role-based access control (admin/client roles)
- Password reset flow with time-limited tokens stored in database
- CSRF protection through session validation

**File Upload System**
- Multer for handling multipart/form-data file uploads
- Sharp for image processing (resize to 256x256, convert to WebP)
- File storage organized by user ID prefix for scalability
- Validation for file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and size limits (5MB max)

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- JSON request/response format
- Middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling
- Request body size limits and raw body preservation for webhooks

**Email Service**
- Nodemailer for SMTP email delivery
- HTML email templates for password reset
- Configurable SMTP settings via environment variables

## Database Layer

**ORM & Schema**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (via Neon serverless driver)
- Shared schema definitions between frontend and backend using Zod

**Data Model**
- Users table with fields: id, email, password, name, celular, externalId, role, avatar, status, lastActive, createdAt, resetToken, resetTokenExpiry
- UUID primary keys using PostgreSQL's gen_random_uuid()
- Unique constraints on email and externalId (when non-null)
- Timestamp tracking for creation and last activity

**Validation**
- Zod schemas for runtime validation and type inference
- Drizzle-Zod integration for automatic schema generation
- Separate insert/select/update schemas with appropriate field exclusions

## Build & Deployment

**Development Mode**
- Vite dev server on port 5000 for frontend
- Concurrent tsx execution for backend with hot reload
- Source maps enabled for debugging

**Production Build**
- esbuild for backend bundling with selective dependency externalization
- Vite static build output to dist/public directory
- Server serves static files and falls back to index.html for SPA routing
- Bundle optimization: specific dependencies bundled to reduce filesystem calls

**Code Organization**
- Monorepo structure with client/, server/, and shared/ directories
- Path aliases configured: @/ for client, @shared/ for shared code, @assets/ for assets
- TypeScript strict mode enabled across all code

## Development Tools

**Replit Integration**
- Custom Vite plugins for Replit-specific features (cartographer, dev banner, runtime error overlay)
- Meta image plugin for dynamic OpenGraph image URL generation
- Environment detection for Replit-specific functionality

# External Dependencies

## Database
- **Neon Postgres**: Serverless PostgreSQL database accessed via @neondatabase/serverless driver
- **DATABASE_URL**: Connection string required in environment variables

## Email Service
- **SMTP Server**: Configurable email delivery service
- Required environment variables: SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_FROM

## Password Recovery (Dual Method)
- **Email Recovery**: Uses SMTP configuration to send password reset emails
- **WhatsApp Recovery**: Integrates with external endpoint for WhatsApp-based password reset
- Required environment variable: `ACCOUNT_RECOVER_WA_ENDPOINT` - External API endpoint for WhatsApp recovery

### Recovery Flow
1. User enters email address
2. System calls `ACCOUNT_RECOVER_WA_ENDPOINT` with `event=check` payload containing: email, celular, external_id
3. Endpoint returns available methods (email and/or whatsapp)
4. User selects preferred recovery method
5. System calls endpoint with `event=recovery` payload containing: method, email, celular, external_id, userName, token, resetUrl

## Third-Party Libraries

**UI & Styling**
- Radix UI component primitives (~30 packages for dialogs, dropdowns, tooltips, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for processing
- Lucide React for icons

**Form Management**
- React Hook Form for form state
- Zod for schema validation
- @hookform/resolvers for Zod integration

**Data Fetching**
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Native fetch API with credential support

**Image Processing**
- Sharp for server-side image manipulation

**Date Handling**
- date-fns for date formatting and manipulation with i18n support (pt-BR locale)

**Session Management**
- express-session for session handling
- connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store (referenced in dependencies)

**Security**
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Environment-based session secrets

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session encryption
- `APP_URL`: Base URL for email links
